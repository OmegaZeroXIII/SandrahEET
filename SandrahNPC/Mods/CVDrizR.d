==CVSandrJ~Drizzt!! I have recognised your recent tracks already and was so nervous you would start the final battle alone.~ 
==CVDrizR~Oh, my ever-caring Sandrah...I have to admit I might have been so foolish if I could have only got beyond that door here alone.~
=~I received the reports from the friends you rescued and also from brother Martin, so I was able to sneak up to here. But now I found myself stuck.~
==CVSandrJ~It is good we are all here together to free Cattie-Brie and end this spook. You would have risked your life uselessly without the dragon breath we have captured to destroy that cursed crystal.~
==CVDrizR~Good to hear, my friends. Let us face those bastards then and put an end to their intrigue!~
