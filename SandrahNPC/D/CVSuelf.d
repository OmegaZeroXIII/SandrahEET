==CVSandrJ~ Even now you still call me an *outsider*. Is that attitude not what has caused your injuries as well as the injuries done to the city and your queen?~
==CVSUELF~ Give me a name then, friend, so I can tell my folks whom to thank.~
==CVSandrJ~Tell them it was <CHARNAME>, tell them of <PLAYER2>, <PLAYER3>, <PLAYER4>, <PLAYER5>, and <PLAYER6>...~
==CVSUELF~Sandrah? Sandrah of Waterdeep? You will not remember me, small as you have been. You were here once with your father. We know you well and you are scarcely an outsider.~
==CVSandrJ~My memory is truly vague of the elven cities I have seen in my youth. Only the feeling they gave me has remained. It is not present here at the moment but we will soon restore it again.~
==CVSUELF~You all go with the blessings of Rillifane, my friends.~EXIT
