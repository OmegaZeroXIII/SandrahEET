~(Pelligram comes up to Sandrah and quietly caresses her mistress' leg with her snout.) A deep satisfied purring comes from her dangerously looking mouth.~
== BSANDR ~Oh, Pelligram! Good to see you, my beautiful pussycat .~
== PELLIG ~ (Rolls onto her back and offers Sandrah her spotted belly to caress.)~
== BIMOEN IF ~ InParty("Imoen2") ~ THEN ~ Huh, nice little pussycat, just had a few mice too many, I guess. By the way, what is it really, never seen such kind.~
== BSHART IF~ InParty("Sharteel") ~ THEN ~ What a proud female. It is a pleasure to see such power and grace move. She is deadly for any male that tries to stand in her way. ~
== BVICON  IF~ InParty("Viconia") ~ THEN ~ As beautiful as a deadly spiderqueen. ~
== BKIVAN  IF~ InParty("Kivan") ~ THEN ~ An animal of utmost grace and danger at the same time. Where did you find it and how could you befriend such a terrific beast? ~
== IF_FILE_EXISTS BSUFINCH  IF~ InParty("Sufinch") ~ THEN ~  (Scribble, scribble) The most dangerous animal I had ever seen came to her side like a tamed pet... ~
== BAJANT  IF~ InParty("Ajantis") ~ THEN ~ You still pet this cat, Sandrah, oh keep your claws away from me, Pelligram, I know what they can do.~
== IF_FILE_EXISTS k-roseB  IF~ InParty("k-rose") ~ THEN ~ The story of taming such a beast must be good stuff for a bard's tale. ~
== IF_FILE_EXISTS ACBreB IF~ InParty("ACBre") ~ THEN  ~ Buzzurk! You and your strange habits of holding all kind of pets. Keep these hairy things away from me. ~
== BBRANW  IF~ InParty("Branwen") ~ THEN ~ By Tempus, strong and proud, a fighter at first sight. ~
==IF_FILE_EXISTS ~BB!GAVIN~ IF~InParty("b!gavin") ~ THEN  ~This is her pet? A simple cat won't do for her...I wonder what that says about her choice in companions?~
== IF_FILE_EXISTS BRH#ISRA  IF~ InParty("RH#ISRA") ~ THEN ~A manifestation of beauty, a creature of Sune? Ah no, probably a creature of Mystra...~
==BNeera IF~InParty("Neera")~THEN~I had once wished for a kitten but was afraid I might turn it into a frog or so -or into something dangerous...like this.~
== BXANNN  IF~ InParty("Xan") ~ THEN ~ So if I die by the claw of a terrible beast that is fine. At least it is all over quickly then for me. ~
== EDWIN IF ~ InParty("Edwin") ~ THEN ~ (Oh, could I only master that magnificent girl the way she masters her large cat - gosh, I'd even go as far as being content with being that cat myself...She drives me mad...)~
== BCORAN  IF~ InParty("Coran") ~ THEN  ~ A watchdog for the treasures of this house. Uh, bad news indeed. ~
==Pellig IF~InParty("Dorn")~THEN~Grrowl!!~
==BDorn IF~InParty("Dorn")~THEN~Aarg, breathe not at me, hellish creature!~
== BJenli IF~ InParty("CVJenlig") ~ THEN ~Not a red dragon you tame, priestess, but has power more than pets of manlings usually have.~
== BDYNAH  IF~ InParty("Dynaheir") ~ THEN ~ Graceful and scaring. I sense a creature of the Shining Plains.~
== BJAHEI  IF~ InParty("Jaheira") ~ THEN ~ You live in balance with nature and the beasts, Sandrah, just like your mother once did.~
== BSANDR ~ Let me introduce you to Pelligram, my Black Plainscat, a panther from the Shining Plains of Ormoth. I rescued her as a baby from some hunters who wanted to train and sell her to the fighting pits of Amn. She has become my friend when we grew up together. ~
== HAIASS IF~ InMyArea("Haiass") ~ THEN ~ (Haiass slowly moves up to the large cat and starts to sniff on her.)~
== PELLIG IF~ InMyArea("Haiass") ~ THEN ~ (Turns her face to Haiass all grace and beauty and starts to inspect the wolf in return.) Gentle purr.~
== BSANDR IF~ InMyArea("Haiass") ~ THEN ~ Who said that cats and dogs cannot be friend? Look at those two. ~
== BSANDR ~ So it seems to be agreed that Pellingram will come with us from now on.~
