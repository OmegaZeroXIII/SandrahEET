~The figure that approaches you seems to stagger for a moment when he detects you.)~
==CVHaeSar IF~Global("SanRomPath","GLOBAL",1) ~THEN~Ha, my brother and his ever faithful companion Sandrah. Honestly the last mortals I expected to meet down here. Has the calling of the blood finally got to you as well, BROTHER?~
==CVHaeSar IF~Global("SanRomPath","GLOBAL",2) ~THEN~Ha, my sister and her ever faithful companion Sandrah. Honestly the last mortals I expected to meet down here. Has the calling of the blood finally got to you as well, SISTER?~
==CVSandrJ~Sarevok, have you still not learned that <CHARNAME> is not your kin and family and will never be. You are ever so arrogant to think that the only reason for us to be here could be YOU.~
==CVHaeSar~Puzzled) That is not the case?~
==CVSandrJ~We are already leaving - with one of our comrades who did not belong to this environment.~
==CVHaeSar~I have long underestimated you, young priestess, but now I know better. You jump into the Nine Hells if your loyalty and love demands it of you - same as your loyalty and love for a Bhaalspawn shattered all my dreams and hopes.~
=~In that way I have already considered that you have done me a great favour.~
==CVSandrJ~By preventing you to succeed in your ambition to become Bhaal, the God of Murder? ~
==CVHaeSar~(Nods.) The last vision my mortal eyes have seen I will never forget. It was that hammer you carry coming down upon me for that fatal blow. I wonder if my surviving sibling knows how close death walks beside <PRO_HIMHER> all the time.~
==CVSandrJ~<CHARNAME> is not you and has nothing to fear from me other than my never-ending love.~
==CVHaeSar~My new form of existence has given me insight into many new aspects of the planes. This includes some knowledge into your role and destiny, granddaughter of Mystra!~
=~But enough of that now. Chances are good that our paths across this multiverse cross again - Sandrah of Waterdeep.~ DO~EscapeArea()~EXIT
