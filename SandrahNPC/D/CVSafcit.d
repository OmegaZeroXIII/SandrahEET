== CVSafgua~ Stand, citizens, you are under arrest.~
== BSAFAN~ You? I did nothing to you, we just had a little chat the other day...~
== CVSafcit ~ You hear it, officer, she does not even deny it!~
== BSAFAN~ What is there to deny? I already denied you the cheap pleasure you were after, man. Is that your revenge now?~
== CVSafgua~ Citizen, do not talk to the culprit. This is matter of the law now. You all come with us now to the Flaming Fist headquarter.~
== BSAFAN~ Hey, but why?~
== CVSafgua~ You are accused of piracy, murder, theft, the whole catalogue to hang your type quickly. (After a little fun, of course - he eyes Safana and Sandrah lustrous.)~
== BSANDR ~ Is your past of your Exzesus trips catching up with you now?~
== BSAFAN~ (Blushes deep red.) But...but that is not possible...it is just...no, no, no. This all must be a big mistake somehow. They CANNOT have any evidence against me!~
== BSANDR ~ Officer, is that right? What are the *exact* accusations and what is the evidence that our comrade here was involved in the deeds?~
== CVSafgua~ Lady, this citizen has just identified her without doubt...~
== CVSafcit ~ Yes, yes, yes...~
== CVSafgua~ Shut up unless you are addressed, citizen! You will all come immediately to headquarters with me, the Duke will see into this case.~
