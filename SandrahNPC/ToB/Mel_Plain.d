==CVSan25J IF ~InParty("CVSandr") OR(2) InMyArea("CVQidr") PartyHasItem("CVQCall")~THEN~You never had a chance to succeed - neither for your own ambitions nor for the case you had really followed Bhaal's orders.~
==Finmel01 IF ~InParty("CVSandr")OR(2) InMyArea("CVQidr") PartyHasItem("CVQCall")~THEN~YOU!! Priestess, you and your goddess have dared to intervene again and again. You should not be here at all but dead since long already. But never mind, this will all be corrected now.~
==CVSan25J IF ~InParty("CVSandr")OR(2) InMyArea("CVQidr") PartyHasItem("CVQCall")~THEN~With the essence of Qilandrha missing from your equations and the power of Mystra against you, you will fail.~
==Finmel01 IF ~InParty("CVSandr")OR(2) InMyArea("CVQidr") PartyHasItem("CVQCall")~THEN~Who by the Nine Hells is Qilandrha?~
==CVQidr IF~InParty("CVSandr") InMyArea("CVQidr")~THEN~I am Qilandrha - born to Khalindra of Mystra's bloodline, sired by Bhaal.~
==CVSan25J IF ~InParty("CVSandr")OR(2) InMyArea("CVQidr") PartyHasItem("CVQCall")~THEN~Tragic if it were not so laughable, Amelyssan. Did Bhaal not tell you about the one he spawned to end Mystra's line? The one who has more of the essence than the Five or even <CHARNAME>.~
==Finmel01 IF ~InParty("CVSandr")OR(2) InMyArea("CVQidr") PartyHasItem("CVQCall")~THEN~A silly bluff - if such a power existed I would know it...it is impossible...Unless - the spawn failed and you are Mystra's descendent who survived...~
==CVSan25J IF ~InParty("CVSandr")!InMyArea("CVQidr") PartyHasItem("CVQCall")~THEN~It is even worse for you, as Qilandrha has defeated the calling of her blood and turned it into a power against Bhaal and yourself.~
==CVQidr IF ~InParty("CVSandr")InMyArea("CVQidr") ~THEN~It is even worse for you, as I have defeated the calling of my blood and turned it into a power against Bhaal and yourself.~END
