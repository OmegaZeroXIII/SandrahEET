~You have always known that <CHARNAME> will one day assume the power inherited by his legacy, didn't you, Sandrah?~
DO~SetGlobal("SanVicPCAss","LOCALS",2)~
==BSandr25~This is a forked question, Viconia. Yes, <CHARNAME> has become a major power in the realms if not on the prime by now.~
=~Yes, more than the current power may be achievable.~
=~Yes or no, it may be a question of the blood or just caused by the way of life we had to take because of that blood.~
=~And the rest is *No*.~
==BVicon25~You will try everything to keep <CHARNAME> from assuming the rightful herritage?~
==BSandr25~Viconia, can you imagine that this heritage may not be the Throne of Bhaal? The power to rule, yes, but not necessarily by creating streams of blood and armies of murderers?~
==BVicon25~It...believe it or not...Sandrah...this is a perspective I would not reject. I confess the vision of power attracts me just as the vision of the Slayer's reign disgusts me.~
==BSandr25~A powerful ruler in control may be the alternative to a maniac beast slaughtering legions.~
==BVicon25~It is always good when we talk. Clarity has been provided by your words.~EXIT
